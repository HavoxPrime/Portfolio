      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome! My name is Storm Morzos and this is my portfolio
        page. It is fortunate that this town has such a talented smith. The
        quality of Larzuk's work surely complements your skills. In fact, he
        would have been quite welcome among the Horadrim.The appearance of the
        mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei
        came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one
        of them. You know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who
        confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to
        you.It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent
        anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to
        continue the pursuit. Ancient lore has it that while Andariel was
        spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.During my time
        with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat. We knew
        that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred
        duty. However, many dismissed their zeal as simple
        superstition...combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders. Those
        Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again...Still, I do
        not believe they died at the hands of the Barbarians.
